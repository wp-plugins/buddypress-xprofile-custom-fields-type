This plugin add custom field types to Buddypress Xprofile extension. Field types are: Birthdate, Email, Url, Datepicker, Custom post type selector, Custom post type multiselector, Checkbox acceptance, Image, File and Colorpicker.

== Description ==

Buddypress installation required!! With Buddypress 1.7, I'm using a new hook "bp_custom_profile_edit_fields_pre_visibility" if you don't have it in your edit profile form or register page, the fields should not appear. Check this if the fields don't appear and you are using Buddypress 1.7.
Add more custom fields type to extended profiles in buddypress: Birthdate, Email, Web, Datepicker, Custom post type, Multi custom post type, checkbox acceptance, image, file, colorpicker, number. 
We add now a new visibility setting 'Nobody' to create fields hidden to all members of buddypress.
Works with <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-xprofile-custom-fields-type/" title="BP Profile Search">BP Profile Search plugin</a> searching birthdate and age range.
If you need more fields type, you are free to add them yourself or request me at miguel@donmik.com. I've moved this plugin to <a href="https://github.com/donmik/buddypress-xprofile-custom-fields-type">github</a>, you can contribute now.
